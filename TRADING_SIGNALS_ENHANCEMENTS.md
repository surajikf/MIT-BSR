# Trading Signals System Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the trading signals system, including new status partitions, multiple timeframe support, and improved signal management.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. Enhanced Signal Status System
The system now supports more granular signal statuses to better track signal lifecycle:

- **`active`** - Signal is still running and valid
- **`hit_sl`** - Stop loss level was reached
- **`hit_tp1`** - First take profit target reached  
- **`hit_tp2`** - Second take profit target reached
- **`expired`** - Signal expired due to time limit
- **`market_invalid`** - Market trend changed, signal no longer valid
- **`technical_invalid`** - Technical indicators changed, signal invalid

### 2. Multiple Timeframe Support
Signals now support multiple chart timeframes:

- **5m** - 5-minute charts (purple badge)
- **15m** - 15-minute charts (blue badge) 
- **1h** - 1-hour charts (green badge)
- **4h** - 4-hour charts (yellow badge)
- **1d** - 1-day charts (red badge)

### 3. Market Trend Tracking
Each signal now includes market trend information:

- **Current Trend**: bullish, bearish, sideways, or unknown
- **Trend Strength**: 0-100% confidence in trend direction
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last trend update

### 4. Enhanced Signal Cards
Signal cards now display:

- Timeframe badges with color coding
- Market trend indicators
- Enhanced status information
- Price history tracking
- Outcome details with reasons

### 5. Comprehensive Statistics Dashboard
New `SignalStats` component provides:

- Total signal counts by type
- Performance metrics (success rate, avg confidence)
- Status breakdown visualization
- Timeframe distribution
- Market-specific summaries

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Signal Model

  trendStrength: Number,     // 0-100%
  lastUpdated: Date
},
outcome: {                   // Enhanced outcome tracking
  reason: String,            // Why signal closed

The enhanced Signal model includes new fields. Existing signals will work with default values, but new signals will have full functionality.

## 📝 Usage Examples

### 1. Filtering by Timeframe
```javascript
// Filter for 5-minute signals only
const fiveMinSignals = signals.filter(s => s.timeframe === '5m');
```

### 2. Checking Signal Status
```javascript
// Check if signal is still valid
const isValid = signal.status === 'active' && 
                signal.marketTrend.currentTrend !== 'unknown';
```

### 3. Getting Performance Stats
```javascript
// Calculate success rate
const closedSignals = signals.filter(s => s.status !== 'active');
const successRate = (closedSignals.filter(s => 
  s.outcome?.profitLoss > 0
).length / closedSignals.length) * 100;
```
